# Request Handler Workflow

When receiving a user request, follow this process:

## Step 1: Classify the Task

Identify which of the 4 categories the request belongs to:

| Icon | Type        | Keywords to Detect |
|:----:|:------------|:-------------------|
| 🔍 | **CONSULT** | "should", "recommend", "compare", "suggest", "advice" |
| 🏗️ | **BUILD**   | "create", "make", "build", "add", "implement", "write" |
| 🔧 | **DEBUG**   | "error", "bug", "not working", "wrong", "fix" |
| ⚡ | **OPTIMIZE** | "slow", "refactor", "clean", "improve", "optimize" |

> **Note:** If unclear → Ask the user before proceeding.

## Step 2: Execute Based on Mode

### 🔍 CONSULT Mode

1. Clarify context & constraints
2. Provide 2-3 options with clear trade-offs
3. Recommend the optimal option with reasoning
4. **WAIT for confirmation** before coding

### 🏗️ BUILD Mode

1. Confirm scope & acceptance criteria
2. Propose file/component structure
3. Code in order: Types → Logic/Hooks → UI → Styles
4. Run checklist before delivery

### 🔧 DEBUG Mode

1. Gather info: what, where, when
2. Analyze root cause
3. Propose fix + explanation
4. Suggest prevention measures

### ⚡ OPTIMIZE Mode

1. Measure baseline
2. Identify main bottlenecks
3. Propose improvements + predict results
4. Refactor + compare before/after
